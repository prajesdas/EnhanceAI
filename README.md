# EnhanceAI

EnhanceAI is an AI-powered image enhancement tool designed to improve image quality through advanced techniques such as denoising, super-resolution, and color correction. It leverages deep learning algorithms to refine and restore images, making them sharper, clearer, and more visually appealing.

## Features
- **Denoising**: Removes unwanted noise from images while preserving essential details.
- **Super-Resolution**: Enhances image resolution without losing quality.
- **Color Correction**: Adjusts and enhances colors for more vibrant and natural-looking images.

## Installation

To use EnhanceAI, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/EnhanceAI.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```sh

## Usage

1. Run the script:
   ```sh
   python enhanceai.py --input path/to/image --output path/to/output
   ```
2. Adjust enhancement parameters as needed (e.g., denoising strength, resolution scale, and color balance).
